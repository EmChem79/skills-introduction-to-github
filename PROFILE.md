Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm learning about git and github, I'm working on understanding how the various options interact (github.com and desktop). I thought this was allowing me to edit text in the desktop app, but my editor is set to Visual Studio Code, so it looks as though I'm doing it there. 

I've added this text and made it autosave. By clicking on the branch icon, I can then push my added text to a commit.

To test something else, I've created a sub-branch to the second branch. I need to work on my branch names. Once the changes have been committed and pushed, I can go to the pull requests on github.com or on the desktop app. 

I thought I had lost these changes just now, but I found a way to get it back. I'm not really sure where that was though. Anyway, I will just commit this but not push it, as I don't really want to make it public.
